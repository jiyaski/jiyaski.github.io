### Personal website 

Built with Vue + Vite. Live site is [here](https://jiyaski.github.io). 

The purpose of this site is threefold: 
- a portfolio to advertise myself to potential employers 
- to have more of an online presence and get more comfortable sharing things publicly 
- as an excuse to learn Vue.js (and possibly a sandbox for other small web things)
